# LangChain Guide for JavaScript/TypeScript üöÄ

**LangChain** is a powerful framework for building applications powered by large language models. It lets you compose context-aware, multi-step ‚Äúchains‚Äù of prompts, LLM calls, tools, and memory to create smart apps. The diagram below illustrates the LangChain stack: at the core is a **Protocol** (the LCEL), wrapped by the **LangChain Core** (Chains/Agents/Prompts), extended by integrations (models, tools, vector stores), and supported by tools like LangSmith and LangServe.

 *Figure: LangChain‚Äôs architecture stack ‚Äì core protocols, components, and integrations (from LangChain docs).*

LangChain makes it easy to connect prompts to LLMs, add tools and memory, and deploy the whole thing as an API. It‚Äôs written in TypeScript, so it fits naturally into modern JS/TS stacks. Along the way we‚Äôll crack a few jokes üòÑ, point out quirks, and toss in some helpful emojis to keep things friendly üòä.

## Installation & Setup üõ†Ô∏è

To start, install LangChain via npm (or yarn/pnpm). The basic package is `langchain`, which includes core abstractions:

```bash
npm install langchain @langchain/core
```

Then import the modules you need. For example, to use OpenAI models and prompts: 

```typescript
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

const model = new ChatOpenAI({ temperature: 0.7 });  // an LLM instance
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromPromptMessages([
  SystemMessagePromptTemplate.fromTemplate("You are a helpful assistant."),
  HumanMessagePromptTemplate.fromTemplate("What is the capital of France?")
]);

// Chain the prompt to the model:
const response = await (prompt.pipe(model)).invoke({});
console.log(response.text);  // Outputs: "Paris"
```

Above, we set up a chat model (`ChatOpenAI`), created a prompt template, and **piped** it into the model. The `invoke` call runs the chain. (No actual metal chains involved ‚Äì but it *is* a chain of operations, pun intended üòú!) 

You may need API keys (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY`) as environment variables. For other providers like Anthropic, Vertex, or Cohere, just install the corresponding `@langchain/xxxx` package and initialize it similarly.

## Core Components

LangChain‚Äôs core modules include **Prompts**, **LLMs**, **Chains**, **Agents**, and **Memory**. Let‚Äôs look at each with simple examples:

- ### Prompts üìã  
  Prompt templates help format instructions to the LLM. For example, a chat prompt template can combine system and user messages:
  
  ```typescript
  import { ChatPromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";

  const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromPromptMessages([
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate.fromTemplate("You are a friendly assistant."),
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.fromTemplate("Tell me a joke about cats.")
  ]);
  ```

  Here `{template}` strings and placeholders can be used. Prompts keep your instructions modular and reusable. They‚Äôre usually piped into a model (e.g. `prompt.pipe(model)`).

- ### LLMs ü§ñ  
  LangChain provides interfaces to many LLM providers. For instance, using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models:

  ```typescript
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-4", temperature: 0.5 });
  const res = await model.call("Say something nice!");
  console.log(res.text);
  ```

  You can also use other models (Anthropic Claude, Azure OpenAI, VertexAI, etc.) with similar classes. The models take your prompts and produce text (or structured output).

- ### Chains üîó  
  A **Chain** sequences operations. The simplest is `LLMChain`, which pairs a prompt with an LLM. For example:

  ```typescript
  import { ChatPromptTemplate } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";

  const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromTemplate("Make up a {adjective} joke.");
  const llm = new ChatOpenAI();
  const chain = prompt.pipe(llm);
  const result = await chain.invoke({ adjective: "spooky" });
  console.log(result.text); // e.g. "Why did the ... ü¶á"
  ```

  You can also build more complex chains (retrieval-augmented, QA chains, etc.). LangChain even has helper classes like `ConversationChain` for chatbots. The pipeline flow is: **Prepare inputs** ‚Üí **Run LLM** ‚Üí **Parse output**.

- ### Agents ‚ö°  
  Agents let the model call *tools* automatically. Think of an agent as a reasoning loop: it queries the LLM for what to do, executes a tool, then loops, until a final answer. For example, you might give it tools like a calculator or web search. Under the hood, it follows a flow like:

   *Figure: Tool-calling flow in a LangChain agent: user query ‚Üí model suggests a tool call ‚Üí tool executes ‚Üí model returns final answer.*

  ```typescript
  // Pseudocode example (actual API may vary):
  import { initializeAgent } from "@langchain/agents";
  const tools = [wikiTool, calcTool];  // predefined tools
  const agent = await initializeAgent(model, tools);
  const answer = await agent.call({ input: "What's 13 factorial?" });
  console.log(answer.text);
  ```

  The agent consults the LLM to decide which tool(s) to use. This is great for complex tasks, but adds complexity and potential unpredictability. (If it calls the wrong tool or goes in loops, debugging can be üêå slow. LangSmith helps to trace these steps.)

- ### Memory üß†  
  Memory lets your app remember past interactions or facts. LangChain has memory classes like `BufferMemory` and `SummaryMemory`. For example, `BufferMemory` accumulates chat history:

  ```typescript
  import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
  import { BufferMemory } from "@langchain/memory";
  import { ConversationChain } from "@langchain/chains";

  const model = new ChatOpenAI({});
  const memory = new BufferMemory();
  const conversation = new ConversationChain({ llm: model, memory });

  const res1 = await conversation.call({ input: "Hi! I'm Jim." });
  console.log(res1.response);  // e.g. "Hi Jim!"
  const res2 = await conversation.call({ input: "What's my name?" });
  console.log(res2.response);  // Learns and says "You said your name is Jim."
  ```

  In this snippet, the assistant remembers you introduced yourself. Memory modules are great for chatbots and multi-turn dialogues. You can also use vector-memory (contextual info in a vector DB) or summary memory for long chats.

These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. LangChain under the hood uses **LCEL (LangChain Expression Language)** to pipe data through these components (notice how we used `prompt.pipe(llm)`). You can also `.stream()` outputs for incremental responses. 

## Under the Hood üèóÔ∏è

LangChain abstracts the flow of data. At its core, it‚Äôs a directed graph of ‚Äúrunnables‚Äù (prompts, models, memory, etc.) that process a **RunnerState**. When you do `pipeline.invoke()`, LangChain moves data through that graph. For example, in `LLMChain`, the input variables are filled into the prompt template, sent to the model (`ChatOpenAI`), and the text output is returned. 

If you use the new **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)**, you can even stream responses. For instance, `const stream = llmChain.stream(inputs)` produces an async iterator of text tokens.

Behind the scenes, LangChain handles a lot of glue code: it formats prompts as messages for chat models, parses JSON if needed, splits prompts for long text, and more. It also manages things like tokenization limits and can interface with LangSmith for tracking. The key idea: **composition over configuration**. You compose building blocks in code (or declaratively via LCEL) to define your application logic.

## When to Use What ü§î

- **Simple LLM calls:** Use a Prompt + LLM (e.g. `ChatOpenAI`) when you just need to ask the model something directly.
- **Structured workflows:** Use Chains when you have a fixed sequence (e.g., "search for info" + "summarize").
- **Tool-using workflows:** Use Agents when the model should decide what tools (APIs, calculators, etc.) to invoke dynamically.
- **Chatbots:** Use `ConversationChain` or a custom chain with `BufferMemory` to hold history.
- **Retrieval/Q&A:** Use a vector store + retriever to fetch relevant docs, then chain with LLM for answer.
- **Embeddings & Vectors:** When you need similarity search or semantic retrieval, use the Embeddings + VectorStore components (covered below).

Remember: LangChain is an opinionated framework, so it shines when your task fits its paradigm (LLMs + modular components). If you need total custom logic with micro-optimizations, it might feel heavy. Think of it like a **smart pipeline library** for AI ‚Äì sometimes it abstracts too much, but often it saves boilerplate.

## Pros & Cons üìàüìâ

**Advantages:**

- **Modular & Composable:** Easy to mix prompts, LLMs, tools, and memory blocks. Great for RAG, chatbots, and multi-step flows.
- **TypeScript Support:** Written in TS with type definitions. You get compiler checks (though see cons) and can integrate into Node or Deno apps smoothly.
- **Ecosystem & Integrations:** Tons of built-in integrations (OpenAI, Azure, Pinecone, S3, etc.) and community extensions.
- **Cross-Environment:** Runs on Node.js, Vercel/Next, Cloudflare, and even browser settings.
- **Active Development:** The JS docs, examples, and community are growing. Constantly evolving with new features.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Documentation Lag:** As one user put it, the JS/TS version often *lags behind* the Python one in features and docs. You might need to dig into source code or wait for updates.
- **Type Safety Woes:** Ironically, despite TS, LangChain‚Äôs abstractions (dynamic chains, prompts, etc.) can lead to runtime errors if you miss a variable. The TS types aren‚Äôt foolproof for every chain step.
- **Overhead:** If your use case is simple, LangChain may feel heavyweight (lots of classes and pipelining). For tiny scripts, raw API calls might be easier.
- **LLM Limitations:** Any model framework inherits LLM quirks (non-determinism, hallucinations, tokens). Chains and agents can sometimes go off-track or need careful prompting.

In short: LangChain speeds up complex AI apps, but adds its own learning curve. It‚Äôs fantastic for prototype-to-prod pipelines, but overkill for one-off requests. ü¶úüòâ

## Integrating with Vercel AI SDK üì¶

If you‚Äôre building on Next.js or Vercel, there‚Äôs a handy **LangChainAdapter** in Vercel‚Äôs AI SDK. LangChain by itself doesn‚Äôt handle streaming to a React client, so Vercel provides an adapter to bridge that gap. For example:

```typescript
// app/api/chat/route.ts
import { ChatOpenAI } from "@langchain/openai";
import { LangChainAdapter } from "ai";

export const runtime = "edge";
export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { prompt } = await req.json();
  const model = new ChatOpenAI({ model: "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613" });
  const stream = await model.stream(prompt);  // LCEL stream or .stream() on chain
  return LangChainAdapter.toDataStreamResponse(stream);
}
```

Then in your React component, use Vercel‚Äôs `useCompletion` or `useChat` hook:

```tsx
'use client';
import { useCompletion } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function ChatPage() {
  const { completion, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useCompletion({
    api: '/api/chat/route'
  });
  // ...
}
```

This wires up the LangChain model to the UI. As of 2025, the Vercel docs for LangChain are still evolving, so be sure to check the **[Vercel AI SDK docs](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/adapters/langchain)** frequently. (They even support streaming from LCEL `.stream()` responses.) In short, use `LangChainAdapter` and Vercel hooks to seamlessly integrate LangChain chains with your frontend.

## Vector Embeddings & Retrieval üîç

**Embeddings** are numeric vector representations of text. They let you compare semantic similarity (e.g., ‚Äúcat‚Äù vs ‚Äúkitten‚Äù). In LangChain, you generate embeddings with an `Embeddings` class (OpenAI, Cohere, Mistral, etc.). Then you store them in a **VectorStore** for similarity search.

For example, using OpenAI embeddings and an in-memory store:

```typescript
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";
import { MemoryVectorStore } from "@langchain/vectorstores/memory";

const embeddings = new OpenAIEmbeddings({ model: "text-embedding-3-large" });
const vectorStore = new MemoryVectorStore(embeddings);

// Add text documents (as LangChain `Document` objects) to the store:
await vectorStore.addDocuments([
  { id: "doc1", text: "LangChain helps build AI apps." },
  { id: "doc2", text: "FastAPI is great for Python APIs." }
]);

// Later, search for relevant docs:
const results = await vectorStore.similaritySearch("How do I build a chatbot?");
console.log(results[0].pageContent);
```

Here `MemoryVectorStore` holds vectors in RAM. In practice, you might use persistent vector DBs like **Chroma**, **Pinecone**, **Qdrant**, **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search**, etc. (LangChain has adapters for all of these.) 

Vector retrieval is key for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): you embed a query, find nearest documents, and feed them into your LLM prompt.

## Using AstraDB for Vector Storage üìö

For a more robust solution, you can store embeddings in **AstraDB** (DataStax‚Äôs serverless DB) using LangChain‚Äôs `AstraDBVectorStore` (part of `@langchain/community`). First, configure your Astra credentials:

```typescript
import { AstraDBVectorStore } from "@langchain/community/vectorstores/astradb";
import { OpenAIEmbeddings } from "@langchain/openai";

const astraConfig = {
  token: process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN!,
  endpoint: process.env.ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT!,
  namespace: process.env.ASTRA_DB_KEYSPACE!,
  collection: process.env.ASTRA_DB_COLLECTION || "docs",
  collectionOptions: { vector: { dimension: 1536, metric: "cosine" } }
};

const vectorStore = await AstraDBVectorStore.fromDocuments(
  documents, 
  new OpenAIEmbeddings({ openAIApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY }),
  astraConfig
);

// Embeddings are computed and stored in AstraDB:
await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents);
```

Now your vectors live in AstraDB. You can later query them (`vectorStore.similaritySearch(...)`) and LangChain will retrieve matching docs from the database. (Tip: Make sure your dimension and metric match the embedding model.)

Using AstraDB or another managed store ensures persistence and scalability for large datasets. It‚Äôs an excellent way to power RAG in production.

## TL;DR

- **LangChain** is a JS/TS framework for LLM-powered apps (chatbots, RAG, etc.). It‚Äôs installed via npm (`langchain` plus provider packages) and written in TypeScript.
- Key concepts: **Prompts** (templates for LLM inputs), **LLMs** (model classes like `ChatOpenAI`), **Chains** (pipelines of prompts + models), **Agents** (LLM-driven tool use), and **Memory** (stateful chat history).
- LangChain uses an expression language (LCEL) to compose runnables. You can `.invoke()` or `.stream()` chains. Under the hood it manages message formatting and tooling.
- **Pros:** Modular, lots of integrations, good for rapid AI app dev. **Cons:** Docs/TS sometimes lag Python version, and type safety can be tricky.
- **Vercel AI SDK:** Use the built-in `LangChainAdapter` to stream LangChain results to your client. For example, pipe a ChatOpenAI `.stream()` to `LangChainAdapter.toDataStreamResponse`.
- **Vector Embeddings:** Convert text to vectors (e.g. `OpenAIEmbeddings`) and store in a vector DB (like MemoryVectorStore or Pinecone). Useful for semantic search and RAG.
- **AstraDB Example:** `AstraDBVectorStore.fromDocuments(docs, new OpenAIEmbeddings(), astraConfig)` creates a DB-backed vector store.
- Keep an eye on docs ‚Äì LangChain and Vercel SDK are evolving. Check official guides and stay updated.

Happy chaining! üòÑüîó

## Summary

LangChain provides a high-level toolkit for building AI workflows in JavaScript/TypeScript. You install the `langchain` npm package, then import models and prompts to craft chains of operations. Core abstractions include **PromptTemplates** for formatting, **LLM** classes for model access, and **Chains** to glue them together. Agents add dynamic tool-calling via a feedback loop, and Memory classes let your app remember context. LangChain handles the data flow (through LCEL pipelines) and integrates with many services.

Advantages are rapid composition and a rich ecosystem. Disadvantages include occasional complexity and the need to manage TypeScript types carefully. When deploying on Vercel/Next, the `LangChainAdapter` lets you hook a LangChain stream into the Vercel AI SDK (for example using `useCompletion`). For advanced apps, use **vector embeddings** (e.g. `OpenAIEmbeddings`) stored in a vector store for similarity search. You can use MemoryVectorStore for in-memory tests or managed databases like AstraDB for production.

In summary: LangChain is like a Swiss Army knife for LLM apps in JS/TS. It abstracts away boilerplate, enabling you to focus on logic. Just remember to stay updated with the docs, as both LangChain and adapters (like on Vercel) are actively improving. üòâüöÄ
